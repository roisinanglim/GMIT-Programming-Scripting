## Topic #1 & #2 - Fibonnacci Code 
-----------------------------------
### About Fibonacci Code 
 
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

### About ASCII Code 
ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character.

## Topic #3 - Collatz Conjecture 
----------------------------------

### About Collatz 

Collatz was a German mathematician born in Arnsberg in 1930 and died in 1990 in Bulgaria. 

### About Collatz Conjecture 
This is an unsolved matamatical problem. It starts with any positive integer and always ends with 1. 

* Take any positive integer, n.
* If n is even, divide it by 2.
* If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
* Repeat untill it reaches 1
